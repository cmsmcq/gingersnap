{ g010:  the smallest possible ixml grammar (I think).

  One of a series (initially for test case construction).
  This one is an FSA with 1 (final) state and 0 transitions.
  I do not believe ixml can describe an FSA with 1
  nonfinal state and 0 transitions:  ixml grammars
  require at least one rule.

  L is the set consisting of the empty string.
