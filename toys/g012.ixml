{ g012:  a small ixml grammar:  012

  One of a series (initially for test case construction).

  This one is an FSA with 0 nonfinal states, 1 final state, 2 arcs.
  (I'm not counting the nil arc marking S as final.)

  L is the set containing any string of XML characters other than 
  blank or the C0 characters (tab, CR, LF).
