{ In the manual exercise of creating a regular expression for R_0 for
block, we have:

  s: (omega*, alpha, rb*, sigma?)*, 
     ((omega*, b0)
     |(omega*, alpha, rb*)).

We would like to reduce it.  Letting 

  a = omega
  b = (alpha, rb*)
  c = sigma
  d = b0

gives this grammar, which we are putting into a file in order to calculate
its Gluschkov automaton automatically, since doing so by hand has led to 
errors and frustration. }

s:  (a1*, b1, c?)*, a2*, (d | b2).
