{ g112:  a small ixml grammar:  112

  One of a series (initially for test case construction).

  This one is an FSA with 1 nonfinal state, 1 final state, 2 arcs.
  (I'm not counting the nil arc marking A as final.)

  L is the set containing strings of one or more 'a' and
  nothing else.

S: 'a', A.
A: 'a', A; {nil}.
