Name that software

2021-01-04

This software should go onto Github soon.  It will need a name.

What is it?  Is it mostly a test case generator?

    inquisitor, grand inquisitor, inquisitor generalis
    torquemada
    eniwetok, ivy mike, trinity
    good cop bad cop
    talkin' about my [test case] g-g-g-generation
    Semipalatinsk (Soviet test region)
    Plumbbob

Is it mostly grammar manipulation tools?

    grammar tools
    Gonnet and Tompa
    Mind your grammar
    Quintilian
    Grammar pedant
    Flavius Sosipater Charisius
    Priscian
    gig (generator for ixml grammars)

To avoid having to make that choice at the moment, perhaps something
neutral. A random number generator gives me p. 722 of my Merrian
Webster collegiate.

    loup-garou 'a werewolf; a lycanthrope
    Louvain 'a city in central Belgium'
    Lovelace (Richard, British poet)    
    lovage 'a European apiaceous herb, Levisticum officinale,
        cultivated in old gardens and used as a domestic remedy'

At the moment, eager to stop worrying about this and find something
else pointless to worry about, I lean toward 'lovage'.

From 'g' for grammar or generation and i for xml, obvious candidate are:

    Gironde
    giggle
    gig
    gigue
    Giorgione
    gimcrack
    ginger
    gingersnap
    gingivitis
    gingko
    ginseng
