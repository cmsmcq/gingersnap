Classification of nonterminals

2020-01-10

We can distinguish several classes:

  - recursive nonterminals: N reachable from N. There may be more than
    one distinct cluster of recursive nonterminals

  - pseudo-terminals: constructs we typically want to treat as if they
    were terminals when constructing FSAs.

    These typically define regular languages, but not always: in ixml,
    nothing that can contain S is regular, but we want to treat many
    of them as non-terminals.

    The absolute requirement is that they not be recursive.

  - superior nonterminals:  nonrecursive nonterminals which sit in the
    derivation tree above any recursive nonterminal.

  - other

    The difference between 'other' and pseudo-terminals is a choice
    made in working with the grammar.  


Let R be a recursive nonterminal.  For any N:

00 If not N ->* R and not R ->* N, N is a collateral descendant of a 
superior nonterminal. 

01 If not N ->* R but R ->* N, N is either a pseudo-terminal or other. 

10 If N ->* R but not R ->* N, N is a superior nonterminal. 

11 If N ->* R and R ->* N, N is recursive.
