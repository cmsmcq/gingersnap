<grammar-pipeline>
  <desc>
    <p>Generic pipeline for converting a regular approximation
    (whether an r_k subset or an R_k superset) to a
    deterministic FSA from which test cases can be generated.</p>
    <p>At least, it's mostly generic.</p>
    <p>The make-rtn/@fissile attribute is grammar-specific.</p>
    <p>The expand-references/@nonterminals attribute is currently
    grammar-specific. If we add a way to tell make-rtn not to add
    linkage rules, this could be dispensed with.</p>

    <p>Revisions:</p>
    <p>2021-01-13 : CMSMcQ : normalize-terminals is required,
    not optional, even for a.ixml.</p>
    <p>2021-01-12 : CMSMcQ : revise for a.ixml u5 and O2 
    approximations.</p>
    <p>2020-12-31 : CMSMcQ : made file (but apparently did not
    get it to a working state)</p>

  <normalize-terminals>
    <desc>
      <p>Normalization of terminals is required for
      the determinization step to work, even when
      the grammar appears not to need it: the
      annotations are used in checking determinism.

  <eliminate-unit-rules>
    <desc>
      <p>The FSAs I'm working with have epsilon transitions,
      which of course take the form of unit rules.
      We need to lose them before determinizing.

  <annotate-pc>

      <p>Epsilon elimination does make some states unreachable,
      so let's clear them out.  First re-annotate.</p>
