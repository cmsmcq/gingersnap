  <desc>
    <p>This pipeline takes an ixml grammar and produces an R_0
    superset grammar, in the form of a stack-augmented
    pseudo-regular grammar showing the recursive transition
    network for the input grammar.</p>
    <p>I'm not completely sure I know what I'm doing; I know
    I did this before, but I need a better way to remember
    how to do it.  That's this pipeline, maybe.</p>
