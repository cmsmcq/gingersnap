    Very nice, thought-provoking paper.

    Not seen. Langendoen 1975 says "Chomsky (1959a), moreover,
    provides an algorithm for constructing FAs for sentences generated
    by arbitrary Chomsky-normal-form (CNF) grammars with up to any
    fixed finite degree *n* of center embedding (CE)."

    Grune and Jacob mention this in connection with the creation of
    regular approximations, but there is not enough detail here to
    understand just what they did.

    painful to read.

    Not seen. ACL annotation says "We show that for each context-free
    grammar a new grammar can be constructed that generates a regular
    language. This construction differs from existing methods of
    approximation in that use of a pushdown automaton is avoided . This
    allows better insight into how the generated language is affected. The
    new method is also more attractive from a computational
    viewpoint."

    One of several papers Nederhof has published on the topic; my list
    is probably not complete.

* Parameswaran / Taly 2007. Aditya Parameswaran and Ankur Taly.
Regularization of context free grammars.

    My notes say I got this from
    http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~adityagp/acads/nat-comp/regularization.pdf
    but it appears not to be there anymore. It is not listed on A.P.'s
    current page. Kind of a shame; I found it among the most
    accessible and helpful papers I have seen on this topic.

    Tough sledding.

    When I read this in 2013, I understood almost nothing, but my
    notes suggest that parts of it are useful and that some of the ideas
	embedded in Gingersnap's regular approximations may have come
	from here.
